### Proposed Analytics Solution

The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that will assist bike companies predict the demand for their services. Through data analysis, this project will aid business owners in identifying when to provide bike rentals to consumers to maximize profitability. The findings of this project will also enable bike sharing systems to determine the optimal times to increase their bike inventory for rental, to meet the demands of consumers during peak seasons. By utilizing data-driven insights, bike companies can maximize their profits while providing their customers with the convenience and accessibility they need.
