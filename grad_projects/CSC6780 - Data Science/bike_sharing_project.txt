Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

Consequently, there is a need to forecast bike demand based on an array of factors such as:
weather - the day of the rental is clear, cloudy, snowy, or rainy
date - the date and hour when the bike was taken
the temperature (in celsius) of the day the bike was rented
relative humity, windspeed of the particular day.
This data, which was taken off kaggle.com, has about 17,400 observations and 12 columns. The bike dataset has two special features which describes the demand of bikes and the group that demands it. The columns are casual and registered which describes the number of unregistered memberes who rented the bikes and the number of registered members who did respectively. The last three columns, casual, registered, and count - total number of rentals will be explored as target variables to determine the demand of bikes by group and by total.
The algorithms to be explored are simple linear regression, decision tree regression, and essemble methods. We will also explore the possibity of grouping our target variables and explore classification algorithms like KNN and Decision trees for classification.
