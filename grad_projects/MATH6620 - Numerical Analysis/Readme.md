# METHODS FOR SOLVING INITIAL VALUE PROBLEMS - A Report

---

## Objective

In real-life situations, the differential equation that models a problem is too complicated to solve exactly, therefore one of the ways which is used to solved such problems is using methods which approximates the solution of the original problem. In my report, I discussed methods that approximates solutions at certain specified timestamps.
