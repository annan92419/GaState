### Proposed Analytics Solution

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that will help airline companies
identify services that need to be improved to satisfy their customers and better understand the
needs and complaints of their customers through analysis of their feedback. By incorporating these
insights, airline firms will have the resources they need to enhance customer satisfaction, increase
brand recognition, and ultimately increase revenues.
